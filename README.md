Title: Matching prior pairs connecting Maximum A Posteriori estimation and posterior expectation

Authors: Michiko Okudo (The university of Tokyo), Keisuke Yano (The Institute of Statistical Mathematics)

Abstract: Bayesian statistics has two common measures of central tendency of a posterior distribution: posterior means and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimates. In this paper, we discuss a connection between MAP estimates and posterior means. We derive an asymptotic condition for a pair of prior densities under which the posterior mean based on one prior coin- cides with the MAP estimate based on the other prior. A sufficient condition for the existence of this prior pair relates to α-flatness of the statistical model in information geometry. We also construct a matching prior pair using α-parallel priors. Our result elucidates an interest- ing connection between regularization in generalized linear regression models and posterior expectation.
